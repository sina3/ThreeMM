## Three Men's Morris

This game is variant of classic Tic Tac Toe. Instead of marking all the grid cells with Xs and Os, players take turns to place only three pieces to first achieve a straight line. This gives it more of an unpredictable nature and makes it more fun to play.

More functionality and game options will be added to the game in near future. Please let me know of your suggestions at sinareza@gmail.com
